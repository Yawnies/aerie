# Aerie

Welcome to Aerie, Yuun's newest PDA project made with React!

## What is Aerie?

Aerie is a browser-based PDA with a nice futuristic look that lets you create, read and delete notes ('logs'). What makes Aerie different from Hestia, however, is how it is linked up to a database that actually saves any logs you write for later reading!  
 
This project was made with React with the intention of training my skillz after doing a few tutorials. I think it turned out really neat! It only lacks authentication, so no logging in and checking your own logs - they're universal.
